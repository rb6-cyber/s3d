1.REASONS
---------

Many people, have been fascinated by 3D Desktops. There were/are projects like
3dwm and SUNs Looking Glass among others which try to replace your daily 
boring 2D Desktop. However, 3D GUIs are still hard and uncomfortable to use.

S3d unfortunately does not change that, but gives you a big playground to try 
your own ideas of 3D GUIs. With the simple API you can easily implement own 
interfaces without caring about writing object interaction, model loading or
3D widgets yourself. Many 3D applications can coexist in the same space 
(unlike usual OpenGL apps), just as the windows on your screen. And who knows, 
maybe we can really have a complete usable 3D desktop someday? :)
