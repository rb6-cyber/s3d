1.REASONS
---------

There are several reasons for this project, one of the most influencing
ones is boredem. i'm bored and blessed with too much time, and my gpu is bored
as well with all this computing power which remains unused on common
desktops.

I think a 3d desktop would/could be a very interesting thing (when it works :),
since it gives so many new possibility's in GUI design (or possibilitys in 
confusing users, depends on readers view). 
there are/were other projects like 3dwm which died somehow (3dwm.org is not 
accessable, for me), and I did not understand it's system thou ... looking 
glass from sun seems to be very interesting too, but I haven't tried it out 
yet ... so my ignorance and stupidity were reasons for this project as well :)
