Well ... Hello :)
this should give you a little starting point in my s3d project.

1.REASONS
---------

There are several reasons for this project, one of the most influencing
ones is boredem. i'm bored and blessed with too much time, and my gpu is bored
as well with all this computing power which remains unused on common
desktops.

I think a 3d desktop would/could be a very interesting thing (when it works :),
since it gives so many new possibility's in GUI design (or possibilitys in 
confusing users, depends on readers view). 
there are/were other projects like 3dwm which died somehow (3dwm.org is not 
accessable, for me), and I did not understand it's system thou ... looking 
glass from sun seems to be very interesting too, but I haven't tried it out 
yet ... so my ignorance and stupidity were reasons for this project as well :)

2.INSTALL
---------

2.1 Preparing 

Before being able to install s3d and the sample programs, you need to prepare
the build, and compile s3d. 

2.1.1 Subversion Checkout

If you are using a version directly checked out from subversion, you will need
to setup the GNU autotools first. The following assumes that automake 1.9,
autoconf 2.59 are available and installed into a directory listed in the $PATH
environment variable.

$ ./autogen.sh [--prefix=/some/where] [--disable-debug] [--enable-profiling]

This will create configure, and run it. Use the --prefix command line argument
to select a different prefix to install s3d into. The default is /usr/local, so
binaries will get installed into /usr/local/bin, libraries into
/usr/local/lib, and documentation into /usr/local/share/doc/s3d-version.
If you are not intending to work on s3d, you can use the --disable-debug
argument to disable building a debug version. Likewise, --enable-profiling
will enable a version compiled for profiling.

After configure has been created, you can also use

$ ./configure --help

to learn about more configuration parameters.

2.1.2 Preparing a Released Version

A released version of s3d contains a pregenerated configure script, which you
can run directly:

$ ./configure [--prefix=/somewhere] [--enable-debug] [--enable-profiling]

Releases do not have debugging or profiling enabled by default, if you want these
features you have to enable them with --enable-debug and --enable-profiling,
respectively.

2.2 Building

After configure has finished, you can start the build of s3d:

$ make

in the root directory will compile server, client-lib and the examples
for you.

after that, go

$ cd server
$ ./s3d

fire up the server. if you're lucky, a window appears.now the s3d is listening 
on port 6066. 
now it's time to test some things. on another terminal:

$ cd examples
$ ./3dsloader miu3ds/miu.3ds

now there should appear a rotating cat. you can move with with the middle 
mouse-button pushed.
now you can try the MCP, which is something like a windowmanager in X:

$ cd examples
$ ./dot_mcp

now you should get some fancy window decorations :D
there are a few other examples, just play around

2.3 Installing

You can use the install target to install s3d into the selected prefix. 
Currently, you have to install s3d, otherwise the examples will not get built.

$ make install

Depending on the selected prefix, you may need to become superuser first.

3. WARRANTY
-----------

I've written this program to satisfy myself (in some way), so please don't
assume that it could have ANY USEFULNESS. I just published it because I 
thought someone might find it interesting, but there is no warranty for
anything. if you find bugs or you have ideas what you would like to see
implemented, or patches, please drop me a line.

4. LICENSE
----------

All those things are published under the GPLv2 or later at your option. 
The Library is licensed under the GNU Lesser GPL (LGPL), so you can 
also write close-sourced thing which links to the library (if you 
really have to ...).
if I'm mistaken in any ownership-concerns, please tell me and don't be 
too mad at me, as I have had no idea of licensing at all.
