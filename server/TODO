HIGH:
 - properly buffer incoming network traffic!!
MED:
 - culling for selection-mode - do it with line-culling, not plane-culling!
 - stop networking grepping after some deadline to prevent DoS ...?
 - delete polygon normals when vertex got changed?!
 - endless loop in proccess_args() (getopts) on linux ppc
 - recheck atan()s for mousemotion rotate values
LOW:
 - checking for biggest object is not cool implemented
 - checking on clone sources is not very nice too ...

VLOW:
 - `grep TODO\: *.c *.h` for more ;)

 
IDEAS:
 - ipv6, unix socket support. 
 - put whole processes in display lists?!

WIN32:
 - select() behaves weird?!
 - can't use close(), use SocketClose() instead
 - Master Beej writes:  "... For one thing, you can't use close() to close a socket--you need to use closesocket(), instead. Also, select() only works with socket descriptors, not file descriptors (like 0 for stdin)."
