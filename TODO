dot_mcp:
	* sane paths for applications
	* logout button for use with rc-file
client(portability?!):
	shmat() return (char *) -1 or NULL?! data_ctos/data_stoc should
	really not be 0x0
	3ds reader won't work on linux ppc, probably lots of memory leaks
server:
	* implement mouse movement
	* endless loop in proccess_args() (getopts) on linux ppc

autotools:
	* Apple todo: won't find -lX11 (for s3d_x11gate) while compiling
	* OBJECTPATH for finding the object?
	* We should perhaps check for the correct versions of
	  autotools to avoid some confusion about some warnings.
	  At the time of writing, supported are:
	   automake 1.9, autoconf 2.59, libtool 1.5
