dot_mcp:
	* sane paths for applications
autotools:
	* OBJECTPATH for finding the object?

	* Apple todo: won't find -lX11 (for s3d_x11gate) while compiling
	* "-Wall -pedantic" default in CFLAGS? (if possible)
	* --enable-debug not honored when CFLAGS is set?
	* We should perhaps check for the correct versions of
	  autotools to avoid some confusion about some warnings.
	  At the time of writing, supported are:
	   automake 1.9, autoconf 2.59, libtool 1.5
