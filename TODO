general:
	* FULLSCREEN!
dot_mcp:
	* sane paths for applications
autotools:
	* OBJECTPATH for finding the object?
	* ./configure: line 23422: HAVE_PTHREAD: command not found < huh?
	* ./configure: line 22373: MDL_HAVE_OPENGL: command not found

	* Apple todo: won't find -lX11 (for s3d_x11gate) while compiling
	* "-Wall -pedantic" default in CFLAGS? (if possible)
	* --enable-debug not honored when CFLAGS is set?
	* We should perhaps check for the correct versions of
	  autotools to avoid some confusion about some warnings.
	  At the time of writing, supported are:
	   automake 1.9, autoconf 2.59, libtool 1.5
	* verify the autogenerated s3drc.
Documentation:
	* Build the documentation (to html at least) if the user has
	  docbook stuff installed.
