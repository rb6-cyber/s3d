### 1 Preparing 

Before being able to install s3d and the sample programs, you need to prepare
the build, and compile s3d. 

### 1.1 Subversion Checkout

If you are using a version directly checked out from subversion, you will need
to setup the GNU autotools first. The following assumes that automake 1.9,
autoconf 2.59 are available and installed into a directory listed in the $PATH
environment variable.

$ ./autogen.sh [--prefix=/some/where] [--disable-debug] [--enable-profiling]

This will create configure, and run it. Use the --prefix command line argument
to select a different prefix to install s3d into. The default is /usr/local, so
binaries will get installed into /usr/local/bin, libraries into
/usr/local/lib, and documentation into /usr/local/share/doc/s3d-version.
If you are not intending to work on s3d, you can use the --disable-debug
argument to disable building a debug version. Likewise, --enable-profiling
will enable a version compiled for profiling.

After configure has been created, you can also use

$ ./configure --help

to learn about more configuration parameters.

### 1.2 Preparing a Released Version

A released version of s3d contains a pregenerated configure script, which you
can run directly:

$ ./configure [--prefix=/somewhere] [--enable-debug] [--enable-profiling]

Releases do not have debugging or profiling enabled by default, if you want these
features you have to enable them with --enable-debug and --enable-profiling,
respectively.

### 2 Building

After configure has finished, you can start the build of s3d:

$ make

in the root directory will compile server, client-lib and the examples
for you.

after that, go

$ cd server
$ ./s3d

fire up the server. if you're lucky, a window appears.now the s3d is listening 
on port 6066. 
now it's time to test some things. on another terminal:

$ cd examples
$ ./3dsloader miu3ds/miu.3ds

now there should appear a rotating cat. you can move with with the middle 
mouse-button pushed.
now you can try the MCP, which is something like a windowmanager in X:

$ cd examples
$ ./dot_mcp

now you should get some fancy window decorations :D
there are a few other examples, just play around

### 3 Installing

You can use the install target to install s3d into the selected prefix. 
Currently, you have to install s3d, otherwise the examples will not get built.

$ make install

Depending on the selected prefix, you may need to become superuser first.
