You can read this online on http://s3d.sourceforge.net/doc or compile it yourself,
for example with docbook2html s3d.docbook

These source files are partially automatic generated. To update them you must
run "doxygen xml.doxygen" and ./extractdefinitions.py afterwards.
manpages can then be generated by running "cd manpages && ./build-manpages.sh"
and normal html help will be generated by the normal build process.

When new documentation should generated following files generated by the
mentioned steps are important for the scm:

libs3d/functions.docbook
libs3d/structs.docbook
libs3d/typedefs.docbook
libs3dw/functions.docbook
libs3dw/structs.docbook
libs3dw/typedefs.docbook
manpages/man1/*.1
manpages/man3/*.3 (sgml must not be added to the scm after running ./build-manpages.sh)
manpages/man9/*.9 (sgml must not be added to the scm after running ./build-manpages.sh)
build-manpages.sh
