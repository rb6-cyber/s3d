ANTI-ALIASING WITH OPENGL?
--------------------------

Right now, rendering is not really pretty (as you can probably see),
so we would like to have some anti-aliasing. Is there a (performant)
way to do so?

ALPHA SORTING
-------------

Alpha polygons are blended in the order as they are drawn by opengl-calls,
not in their z-order. Is there any easy way to do so?
