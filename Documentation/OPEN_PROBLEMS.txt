ANTI-ALIASING WITH OPENGL?
--------------------------

Right now, rendering is not really pretty (as you can probably see),
so we would like to have some anti-aliasing. Is there a (performant)
way to do so?

ALPHA SORTING
-------------

Alpha polygons are blended in the order as they are drawn by opengl-calls,
not in their z-order. Is there any easy way to do so?

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

I'd like to convert the old s3dlib.txt in some new format so we can export this 
into man, html, latex (pdf,ps) etc ...
Can you recommend any System? Doxygen? Docbook? I've fiddled with doxygen,
but it slightly confused me ...
