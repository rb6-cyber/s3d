Patches  will  be  applied directly using ‘git am‘ ‐ so please send your
mail as text/plain without PGP  encryption  applied.  The  subject  line
should  act  as  summary  of  your  patch  and  the  body  should have a
meaningful commit message with information about  motivations  for  this
patch  and how it changes the behavior.  Don’t commit commented code and
follow the coding style described at http://s3d.berlios.de/style_guide

The patch must apply without any problems on the desired branch.  So  if
it is a bug fix then it must apply against the maint branch and if it is
new feature or a bug fix only available in the  master  branch  then  it
must  apply  against the master branch.  ‘git format‐patch ‐M‘ should be
used to create these patches. Further changes to this file  should  only
be  done in rare situations. An example could be to add v2 to [Patch v2]
to inform other users that this makes another unapplied patch  obsolete.
If  you  want  to add other information to the patch which should not go
into the commit message then write an extra summary mail  or  add  these
information  in  the  part  between  ‐‐‐  and the diffstat ‐ please test
afterward if the patch still applies cleanly. Don’t paste the patch into
your  mailer  ‐  this will ruin the patch in most cases. Try to use ‘git
send‐email‘ or read  Documentation/email‐clients.txt  inside  the  linux
kernel tree.

Read  Documentation/SubmittingPatches inside the git and linux‐2.6 tree.
Anything but the application specific information should be the same for
s3d.  They are also describing what a good commit messages is, why it is
important to send the mail like it was generated by  ‘git  format‐patch‘
and what the Signed‐off‐by means and how it should be used.

Your  patch must be licensed under the GPL2+ (or LGPL2.1+ for libs3d and
libs3dw).

If you think that your patch is ready for inclusion then send it to
                   s3d‐devel@lists.berlios.de

You must be subscribed to the mailing list or otherwise your  mail  will
be dropped without further notice.
