I hope this gives some useful Information for Icon designer:

- We currently only support 3ds file format.
- All Icons coordinates should be within [-1,-1,-1], [1,1,1]
  so we always have the same size. Its no problem
  to scale them bigger or smaller in s3d.
- Textures are (not yet) supported.
- Alpha blending works somehow, but not very well (see OPEN_PROBLEMS)
- Please keep Polygon number low ... if possible, under 50,
  but always under 100. Icons should not bloat the User workspace.
