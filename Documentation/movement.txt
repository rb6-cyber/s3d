this is not the final version for movement, but ...

- hold middle mouse button (or left+right at once if you have middle-mousebutton-emulation) and move
  your mouse to move around the world
- hold right mouse button and move mouse to rotate the mouse (look around)
- left mouse button is for clicking :)
- presse f1 to get in ego-shooter mode :D you can use w,a,s,d for movement now. f1 again to deactivate.
  this only works with dot_mcp, the others above work out-of-the box within the server.
