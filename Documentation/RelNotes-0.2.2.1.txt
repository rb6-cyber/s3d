S3D v0.2.2.1 Release Notes
==========================

 * Fix minor typographical errors in documentation.

 * Change all references from berlios to the new hoster sourceforge.

 * Update mail information for Marek Lindner, Simon Wunderlich and
   Andreas Langer.

 * Fail earlier in s3dvt during the start of the shell when setuid/setgid fails
   to change euid/egid/fsuid/.. to the uid/gid and don't wait for bash to
   handle it for the terminal emulator. Requested by
   Hector Marco <hecmargi@upv.es>

 * Use versioned symbols for exported libraries to make migration to an
   incompatible ABI easier.

 * Support libgps API 5 in s3dosm.
