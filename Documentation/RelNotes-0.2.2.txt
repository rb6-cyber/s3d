S3D v0.2.2 Release Notes
========================

 * Generate documentation from source code.

 * Allow pseudo global optimisations for each module using -DENABLE_FINAL=ON as
   cmake parameter.

 * Support batman-adv visualisation output and IPv6 addresses in meshs3d.

 * Stricter const usage for strings to better integrate into (e)glibc's stricter
   const usage in version 2.10.

 * Added better support for libraries in unusual places using pkg-config.

 * Support of systems with unusual named OpenGL headers through SDL.

 * Reduced library dependencies of compiled shared objects.

 * Depend on libgps 2.90 for s3dosm GPS support as it is the first version with
   longer binary and API stability.

 * Removed BSD PTY support in favor of Unix98 PTYs for s3dvt.

 * Support to build s3d as position independent executable using gcc's -pie and
   -fPIE option without breaking libs3d(w).
