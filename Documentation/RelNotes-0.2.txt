S3D v0.2 Release Notes
======================

 * Released S3D Version 0.2
 * now using cmake instead of autohell, which seems to be faster,
   more configurable and at least comprehensible (Thanks to Sven
   Eckelmann)
 * meshs3d is a complete rewrite of olsrs3d, using faster
   data structures and clean design (implemented by Andreas Langer)
 * s3dosm is a new program to navigate on openstreetmap maps.
   it has gps-support, superseding the old s3dgps which operated
   on bitmap map files.
 * kism3d (implemented by Marek Lindner) visualizes the wireless
   networks and works as a frontend to kismet
 * texture support is now using mipmaps
 * added a few widgets (textbox/scrollbars)
