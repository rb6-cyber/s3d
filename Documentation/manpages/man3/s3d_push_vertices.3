.SH "Description" 
.PP 
push some vertices from an array. that's much better for performing than using s3d_push_vertex() if you have a lot of vertices (and that's probably the usual case).  
.PP 
.nf 
float vertices[] = { 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 
1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 
3.0, 2.0, 1.0}; 
s3d_push_vertices(object, vertices, 3); // pushing 3 vertices
